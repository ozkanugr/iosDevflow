## Follow-Up Question Patterns

### When answers are vague

- "What would that look like in practice?"
- "If you had to choose just one, which would it be?"
- "How would you measure success for that?"

### When answers reveal complexity

- "That sounds like multiple features. Shall we break it down?"
- "What's the simplest version that would still be valuable?"
- "Are there dependencies between those requirements?"
- "Which part is most critical?"

### When answers conflict

- "Earlier you mentioned {X}, but this seems different from {Y}. How should we reconcile?"
- "Given the timeline, is this realistic for v1.0?"
- "This might impact {other requirement}. What's the priority?"
- "Can we do both, or must we choose?"

### When user says "I don't know"

- "What do similar products do?"
- "If you had to guess, what would you say?"
- "Let me offer some options: [A], [B], or [C]?"
- "Should we mark this as an open question to research?"
